# Vim-Style Motions Specification for pZep

## 1. Overview

This document defines the complete specification for implementing Vim-style motions in the pZep. The goal is exact compatibility with Vim's motion behavior, including integration with operators and text objects.

---

## 2. Basic Motion Categories

### 2.1 Character Motions (Single Character)

| Key | Description | Behavior |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| `h` | Left | Move cursor one character left |
| `j` | Down | Move cursor one line down |
| `k` | Up | Move cursor one line up |
| `l` | Right | Move cursor one character right |

**Edge Cases:**
- `h` at line start: Stay at current position (column 0)
- `l` at line end: Stay at last character
- `j`/`k` at first/last line: Stay on current line

---

### 2.2 Word Motions

| Key | Description | Behavior |
|-----|-------------|----------|

| `ge` | Word end backward | Move to end of previous word |

**Word Definition:**
- Word: Sequence of letters, digits, underscores
- Non-word: Everything else (spaces, punctuation, etc.)

**Edge Cases:**
- `w` at line end: Move to next line's first word
- `b` at line start: Move to previous line's last word

### 3.2 Difference Between Inner and A

- **Inner (`i`)**: Selects only the content, excluding delimiters
- **A (`a`)**: Selects content AND the delimiters

## 4. Operator Integration

### 4.1 Operator List

| Key | Operator | Action |
|-----|----------|--------|
| `d` | Delete | Delete text |
| `y` | Yank | Copy text |
| `c` | Change | Delete and enter insert mode |
| `g~` | Toggle case | Toggle case (upper/lower) |
| `gU` | Uppercase | Convert to uppercase |
| `gu` | Lowercase | Convert to lowercase |
| `>` | Shift right | Increase indentation |
| `<` | Shift left | Decrease indentation |
| `=` | Format | Auto-indent |
| `!` | Filter | Run external command |

### 4.2 Operator-Motion Rules

**Syntax:** `{operator}{motion}`

**Examples:**
- `dw` - Delete word
- `d$` - Delete to end of line
- `dgg` - Delete to beginning of document
- `dfx` - Delete until next 'x' (inclusive)
- `dt;` - Delete until semicolon (exclusive)

**Count Syntax:** `{count}{operator}{motion}` or `{operator}{count}{motion}`

- `2dw` = `d2w` = Delete 2 words
- `3j` = Move down 3 lines

### 4.3 Double Operator

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `dd` | Delete current line |
| `yy` | Yank current line |
| `cc` | Change current line |
| `>>` | Shift line right |
| `<<` | Shift line left |
| `==` | Format line |

### 4.4 Visual Mode Operators

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `d` | Delete selection |
| `y` | Yank selection |
| `c` | Change selection |
| `r` | Replace all selected characters with same char |
| `~` | Toggle case |
| `U` | Uppercase selection |
| `u` | Lowercase selection |
| `>` | Shift right |
| `<` | Shift left |

## 5. Visual Mode

### 5.1 Visual Mode Types

| Mode | Key | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| `v` | Character | Select by characters |
| `V` | Line | Select whole lines |
| `Ctrl+v` | Block | Select rectangular blocks |

### 5.2 Visual Mode Motions

Same as Normal mode motions work in Visual mode.

**Special:**
- `o` - Swap selection start and end (character/block)
- `O` - Swap to other corner of rectangle (block only)

---

## 6. Count Handling

### 6.1 Count in Motions

- `5j` - Move down 5 lines
- `3w` - Move forward 3 words
- `10l` - Move right 10 characters

### 6.2 Count in Operators

- `5dd` - Delete 5 lines
- `2dw` - Delete 2 words
- `3cc` - Change 3 lines

### 6.3 Count in Both

- `2d3w` = Delete 6 words (2 * 3)

---

## 7. Edge Cases and Special Behaviors

### 7.1 Empty Buffers
- `G` on empty buffer: Stay at line 0
- `gg` on empty buffer: Stay at line 0

### 7.2 Motions at Buffer Boundaries
- `k` on line 0: Stay at line 0
- `w` past last word: Stay at last position
- `$` on single line: Stay at last character

### 7.3 Search Failures
- `f`, `F`, `t`, `T` with no match: No movement, no error
- `;` without prior `f/F/t/T`: No movement

### 7.4 Line Wrapping
- `j` and `k` with wrap enabled: Move to next physical line
- `j` and `k` with wrap disabled: Move to next display line

### 7.5 Multibyte Characters
- Motions account for UTF-8 multibyte characters
- `l` on multibyte: Move by visual character, not byte

### 7.6 Special Characters in Search
- `f;` - Find semicolon
- `f` + `Esc` - Cancel search (no movement)
- `f` + `Ctrl+c` - Cancel search

---

## 8. Implementation Guidelines

### 8.1 State Machine

```
Normal Mode
    |
    +-- Operator Pending (after d,y,c, etc.)
    |       |
    |       +-- Motion (after operator)
    |
    +-- Visual Mode (after v, V, Ctrl+v)
    |
    +-- Insert Mode (after i, a, o, etc.)
```

### 8.2 Key Handling

1. **Read key**
2. **Check mode**
3. **If Normal:**
   - Check for operator (d, y, c, etc.)
   - Check for motion
   - Check for special (gg, ZZ, etc.)
4. **If Operator Pending:**
   - Wait for motion
   - Apply operator with motion
5. **If Visual:**
   - Extend selection with motion
   - Apply operator to selection

### 8.3 Required State Variables

```cpp
enum class Mode { Normal, Insert, Visual, VisualLine, VisualBlock, OperatorPending };

Mode current_mode;
char pending_operator;  // 'd', 'y', 'c', etc.
int motion_count;       // Numeric prefix
int selection_start_x, selection_start_y;
int selection_end_x, selection_end_y;
std::string last_search_char;  // For ; and ,
char last_find_char;
bool last_find_reverse;
```
